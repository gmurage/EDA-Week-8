# EDA-Week-8
Exploratory Data Analysis: A Case Problem Week 8. This week you will select one of the datasets (hhpub20.csv) in the data curation repository(Week 8 Resources') and review the specific business need found in the data set documentation. Specifically, you will plan the analysis steps and perform a complete exploratory data analysis on the data set using Python or Rapid Miner Studio. Use descriptive and meaningful comments in the code or process file as documentation. In your paper describe the process used to plan the analysis, explain the process rationale used to perform the following exploratory data analysis processes for the selected data set( with justification for methods chosen), the observations of and the results from the analysis(plus visualizations for each), and the details for insights gained from the process: Measures of Variability and Central Tendency Frequency, Variance, and Standard Deviation Outlier Detection and Distribution Modality Univariate Analysis Methods Cluster Analysis and Data Grouping Be sure appropriate annotated visualizations ( tables, charts, graphs) are properly referenced in the narrative and provided in the appendix. Describe statistical findings and insights obtained as a result and subsequent actions that should be taken with the data set,
