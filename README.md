# EDA-Week-8
Exploratory Data Analysis: A Case Problem Week 8.
This week you will select one of the datasets in the data curation repository(Week 8 Resoruces) and review the speciifc business need found in the data set documentation.
Specifically, you will plan the analysis steps and perform a complete exploratory data analysis on the data set using Python,R or Rapid Miner Studio.
Use descriptive and meaningful comments in the code or process file as documentation.
In your paper describe the process used to plan the analysis, explain the process rationale used to perform the following exploratory data analysis processes for the selected data set( with justification for methods chosen), the obsrvations of and the results from the analysis(plus visualizations for each), and the details for insights gained from the process:
Measures of Variability and Central Tendency
Frequency, Variance, and Standard Deviation
Outlier Detection and Distribution Modality
Univariate Analysis Methods
Cluster Analaysis and Data Grouping
Be sure appropriate  annotated viosualizations ( tables, charts, graphs) are properly referenced in the narrative and provided in the appendix.
Describe statistical findings and insights obtained as a result and subsequent actions that should be taken with the data set
